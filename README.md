## Behaviorial cloning.

This repository is my approach towards Udacity Self-driving car's term 1's project 3.
The project resources can be found at https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3 with a more detailed README.

To run the model training using this solution, grab the Udacity provided data and unzip it into the root directory.
Double check that all data between line 122 and 128 are provided. Then, run:

```sh
python model.py model.h5
```
